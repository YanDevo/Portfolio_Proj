                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>A Front-End Web Developer who is motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming. Responsibilities will include translation of the UI/UX design wireframes to actual code that will produce visual elements of the application.

                <h3>Ecommerce</h3>
                <p>Every online store comes with a website. The design, aesthetic, and functionality of the website have a huge role to play in how the customer finds the online shopping experience. If the website is hard to navigate, slow, and visually unappealing, chances are the customers won’t be too eager to purchase something from that website.

                    For that reason, behind every successful ecommerce business is an outstanding web developer.
                    
                    Job description: the role of every web developer is to design and create the websites used for ecommerce businesses. Basically, it’s their job to take care of the website, both in terms of appearance and performance.
                    
                    Job requirements: web developers are required to have a Bachelor’s degree in Web development or a related field. Needless to say, candidates should also have knowledge in programming and web design. On top of that, they will need to be familiar with applications and practices like JavaScript, CSS, HTML. Web developers should ideally be team players who can work in a team and perform well under stress.</p>

                <h3>SQL & Data</h3>
                <p>In my view, an entry level engineer is the one who can join a team and become productive in 3–4 weeks. An entry level data engineer is expected to know following:

                    Good at SQL queries.
                    Good in one programming language- Java, Python, GO etc.
                    Familiar with development tools like- Github, Jenkins, Docker etc.
                    Familiar with a cloud infrastructure like- AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI etc.
                    Familiar with a development process like- Agile.
                    Great attitude towards learning new things and taking on any kind of tasks. Yes, this is what makes a big difference to the productivity of an entry level data engineer.</p>
